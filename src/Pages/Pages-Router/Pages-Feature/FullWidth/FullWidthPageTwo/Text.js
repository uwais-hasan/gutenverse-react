                Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no larger:
                still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting
                out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.<br/><br/>

                It was much pleasanter at home,’ thought poor Alice, ‘when one wasn’t always growing
                larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn’t
                gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and yet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of
                life! I do wonder what CAN have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied
                that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There ought to be
                a book written about me, that there ought! And when I grow up, I’ll write one—but I’m grown up now,’
                she added in a sorrowful tone; ‘at least there’s no room to grow up any more HERE.’
